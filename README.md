# 💡 GenAI Data Analysis on Tips Dataset
This repository showcases the use of Generative AI tools (ChatGPT & Gemini) to perform end-to-end data analysis on the popular Tips dataset using two approaches:

🔹 Task A: Step-by-step data analysis via ChatGPT instructions (like a beginner learning experience)

🔹 Task B: Generating Python code snippets from ChatGPT (like a data science expert)

## 📌 Objectives
The goal of this project is to explore how GenAI can assist in:

1. Data cleaning & preparation
2. Basic statistical analysis
3. Visualization
4. Python code generation
5. Interpreting insights from datasets
6. Acting as a virtual Data Analyst or Data Scientist

## 🧠 Tools Used
- 💬 ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- 🧠 Gemini (Google AI)
- 🐍 Python (via Google Colab)
- 🗂️ Tips dataset from Seaborn library

## 📝 Tasks Performed
## ✅ Task A – ChatGPT as a Data Analyst
In this approach, ChatGPT was used as an expert mentor to explain and perform analysis tasks step-by-step.
Each prompt was crafted to seek insights, explanations, and visualizations.

Subtasks:
1. Load the Dataset
2. Basic Statistics of 5 Important Columns (Mean, Median, Mode, Std Dev, Min, Max)
3. Check for Missing Values and Outliers
4. Univariate Analysis (Distribution of individual features with visualizations)
5. Bi-variate Analysis (Relation between two features using scatter plots, box plots, etc.)

## ✅ Task B – ChatGPT as a Data Science Expert (Code Only)
In this approach, ChatGPT was prompted to behave like a seasoned data scientist and directly return Python code for each task that can be executed in Google Colab.

Subtasks:
1. Load Data into a DataFrame
2. Generate Python code for:
  -  Statistical summaries
  -  Missing value and outlier detection
  -  Univariate and Bi-variate analysis (with plots)
